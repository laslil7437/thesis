Lucy was feeling brave. She had heard that the street at the edge of town was the most fun street in the entire city! She wanted to see it for herself, so she got dressed and headed out.

Lucy was excited, but she wasn't sure which way to go. "Can you help me?" she asked a policeman. He smiled and said, "Sure. Follow this street and it will take you there."

Lucy thanked the policeman and set off. As she walked, she could see the trees, buildings and cars getting more and more fun. When she arrived at the street, she saw that it was rough and full of giant puddles, but she was still excited.

Lucy jumped and splashed in every puddle she could find. She couldn't believe how much fun she was having! At the end of the street, she met a boy who was playing on a big slide. Lucy said hello and asked if she could join in.

The boy laughed and said, "Sure, come and follow me!" So the two of them slid down the slide together, laughing and smiling the whole way. When the fun was done, Lucy thanked the boy and waved goodbye. What an adventure!

"Look at this blouse!" Lily said. "It is pink and has flowers. It is very soft and pretty. I want to wear it."

Anna looked at the blouse. She liked it too, but she saw a tag on it. It said "Do not wash. Dry clean only."

"Lily, you can't wear that blouse," Anna said. "It is not for playing. It is for special days. And you can't wash it. It will get ruined."

Lily did not listen to Anna. She was stubborn and wanted to wear the blouse. She put it on and looked at herself in the mirror. She felt like a princess.

"Anna, don't be silly," Lily said. "This blouse is fine. It is just a blouse. And I can wash it later. Come on, let's play."

Anna was worried, but she did not want to fight with Lily. She put on a skirt and a hat and joined Lily. They played with their dolls and pretended to have a tea party. They had fun, but they also made a mess. They spilled juice and crumbs on the floor and on their clothes.

Suddenly, they heard Lily's mom coming up the stairs. They were scared. They knew they were in trouble. They tried to hide the box and the clothes, but it was too late. Lily's mom opened the door and saw them.

"Lily! Anna! What have you done?" Lily's mom shouted. "You took my clothes without asking. And you ruined them. Look at this blouse. It is stained and torn. It was my favorite blouse. It was a gift from your grandma. How could you?"

The sun was bright and warm as Sandy and her mom walked to the park. Sandy held her mom's hand as they skipped across the street, giggling and smiling. 

When they got to the park, Sandy spotted a big machine. It had a big round lens on top and it looked a bit like a microscope! 

Sandy asked her mom, "Mommy, what's that?". 
Her mom said "That, sweetie, is a reversing machine! It does something very special." 

Sandy was intrigued and asked, "What does it do?". 
Her mom smiled and said, "Well, it reverses things, silly! You put something in and it comes out the other side all changed around! " 

Sandy wanted to see it for herself, so she ran over to the machine and pressed all the buttons. But when something came out, it wasn't reversed at all - it was exactly the same! Sandy was very confused. 

Her mom came over and said, "Oh, sweetie, that's not how it works. You have to put something in first, then put the reverse button on and press it one more time! Let's give it a try again!" 

And so they did. This time, when something came out of the machine, it was all changed around - just like magic! Sandy smiled and laughed with excitement. She was thrilled - it was
