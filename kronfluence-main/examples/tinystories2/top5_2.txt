Lucy was feeling brave. She had heard that the street at the edge of town was the most fun street in the entire city! She wanted to see it for herself, so she got dressed and headed out.

Lucy was excited, but she wasn't sure which way to go. "Can you help me?" she asked a policeman. He smiled and said, "Sure. Follow this street and it will take you there."

Lucy thanked the policeman and set off. As she walked, she could see the trees, buildings and cars getting more and more fun. When she arrived at the street, she saw that it was rough and full of giant puddles, but she was still excited.

Lucy jumped and splashed in every puddle she could find. She couldn't believe how much fun she was having! At the end of the street, she met a boy who was playing on a big slide. Lucy said hello and asked if she could join in.

The boy laughed and said, "Sure, come and follow me!" So the two of them slid down the slide together, laughing and smiling the whole way. When the fun was done, Lucy thanked the boy and waved goodbye. What an adventure!
